import Social from "../../components/Social.astro";
import Greeting from "../../components/Greeting";

After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

<Social platform="twitter" username="hey" />

<Greeting client:load messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hey there"]} />
