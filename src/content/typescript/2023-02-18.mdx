Today, I learned the basics of TypeScript.

Even though I just started learning TypeScript, I feel like it's gonna be useful for me.

```typescript
const a = document.querySelector(".js-abc");

a.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log(
    "Clicked. This is the sample text that is long and can cause horizontal scroll that is to check the design."
  );

  document.body.classList.add("is-clicked");
});
```

## This is the h2 tag

### This is the h3 tag

My tasks are:

- Add styles to every tags
- Add some plugins to style code block

This is the `code`
